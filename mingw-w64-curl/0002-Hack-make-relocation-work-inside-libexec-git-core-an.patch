Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Hack: make relocation work inside libexec/git-core/ and
 bin/

In Git for Windows, there is a copy of libcurl-4.dll in
/mingw64/libexec/git-core/ (which is where git-remote-https.exe lives,
and the libcurl-4.dll needs to be there because of DLL search path
issues, to prevent any C:\Windows\system32\libcurl-4.dll from being
picked up by mistake).

The current code trying to make libcurl-4.dll relocatable, however, is
unprepared for any path but /mingw64/bin/ (and it does not even verify
that it *is* in that location).

The design of the relocation code seems to be less than conducive to a
proper fix for this issue, so let's just be content with a quick 'n
dirty workaround.

Note: as MinGit does away with libexec/git-core/, we also explicitly
handle the `bin/` directory. Technically, this should not be necessary,
as the CURL_BINDIR is supposedly being handled correctly, but it seems
not to work as advertised in practice. So let's just paper over this and
extend the Git for Windows-specific hack with a hard-code `bin/` case.
